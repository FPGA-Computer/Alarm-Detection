"Alarm detection for hearing impaired"

"Lost in Space" pre-pre release
The PCB I have ordered has been lost in the mail.  This
is the 2nd one in a row and I don't know if/when they
would fix up the shipping.  This has major impact to the
schedule of this project.  Since there don't seem be much 
interest in this, I have decided to do an premptive
release of the firmware at the early stage.
